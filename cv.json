        "keyStrengths": "I started Devine at Howest in 2014 and loved the multimedia environment right away. Devine (professional bachelor) is a blend of programming and design with the focus on the newest technologies. During this time, I worked with other students on several projects and really enjoyed being part of a team. I also discovered that while some of my team members were more design focused, I had more affinity for programming. I decided to fully focus on strengthening my coding skills so I dropped my design courses in the second year. I feel like I have a clear programming edge over some of the students that combined programming and design. I successfully finished all programming courses from the January 2016 curriculum, so I was up to date on all new web technologies when I searched for my first job. I landed my first job in Melle with The Craft where I am currently still employed. The company was founded in 2016 so when I arrived we were only 3 persons strong. Currently we have a strong team of 6 including two senior CEOs from whom I have learned a lot. At The Craft we always look for new technologies to improve our workflow and that’s what keeps things fun.",
